# Comparison-of-Sentimental-Analysis-Techniques
Sentiment Analysis is a form of Natural Language Processing that involves determining a user's or a group of users' feelings as indicated in various comments, requests, or questions posted on the internet. It entails creating a system that can collect user thoughts, analyse them, and categorise them based on the polarity of the post.The first step in sentimental analysis is to identify the topic on which the opinion is directed. The attitude is then categorised as positive (which indicates user satisfaction or enjoyment), negative (which indicates rejection or disappointment), or neutral (which denotes no strong sentiment involved). The sentiment can then be assigned a score that indicates its intensity.
There are various Sentimental Techniques available. I've used  lexicon based approach and ML based approach.
Lexicon Based: TextBlob
ML based: SVM Classifier and Naive Bayes
